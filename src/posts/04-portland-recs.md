A list of all of my favorite places to eat and drink in and around Portland, ME. This is mostly just
a list for list-making's sake - who doesn't love a good list - but also figured it would be a useful
thing to send to folks who are visiting and looking for recommendations. If that's you, enjoy your
trip!

Unless a list is numbered, assume it's unordered. If a business doesn't have a blurb next to it, it
just means that I don't have anything particularly insightful to say about what to get (probably
because it's all good!)

## Eats

### ü´∂ Go-to spots

- [Palace Diner](https://www.palacedinerme.com/) (Biddeford) - the best version of normal diner
  food. Pancakes, french toast, fried chicken sandwich are all 10/10
- [Little Pig](https://www.littlepigportland.com/) - everything is bright, flavorful, and made with
  love. No wrong answers, but I always have to get Piyathida's dumplings and usually GraPow Gai Kai
  Dow
- [Quanto Basta](https://quantobasta.me/) - took me a while to remember how to pronounce "cynar" but
  yeah get the cynar spritz. Always good to try the special and the Amatriciana is my fav of the
  regular pies
- [Goodfire](https://www.goodfirebrewing.com/) (Freeport) - if there's a special, get it. Otherwise
  the chicken sandwich is always a good call and the Little Spruce pretzels rock
- [Crispy Gai](https://www.crispygai.com/) - obviously all their chicken is great but don't sleep on
  the Crying Tiger Ribeye. Top notch cocktails too
- [Sichuan Kitchen](https://www.sichuankitchenportland.com/) - mapo tofu, fried green beans, and
  eggplant are go-tos. If you're in person with a group, get the poached fish in fiery suace
- [Boda](https://www.bodamaine.com/) - usually go apps-heavy, including quail eggs and bacon-wrapped
  scallops
- [Fish and Whistle](fishandwhistlemaine.com) (Biddeford)
- [Little Chippy](https://www.lilchippymaine.com/)

### üé© Special occasions (or when someone else is paying)

- [Scales](https://www.scalesrestaurant.com/) - everything is good but be sure to get cornbread
- [Izakaya Mintao](https://www.izakayaminato.com/) - do the omakase
- [Wayside Tavern](https://www.waysidetavernmaine.com/) - best sazerac in Portland. Gotta get the
  beer battered cod cheek. I love the roasted chicken on ricotta toast and hope some day to try the
  Monday-only burger
- [Fore Street](https://www.forestreet.biz/)
- [Leeward](https://leewardmaine.com/)

### ü•™ Lunch

- [Savlatore's](https://salvatoreshoagieshop.toast.site/order) - best sandwich in Portland and it's
  not close. It's also a lot of sandwich - could pretty easily feed two
- [Nura](https://www.nuraportland.com/) - it's not always on their menu, but I still think about the
  schnitzel pita I got there
- [Taco Trio](https://leewardmaine.com/) (South Portland) - costs a lot more than you want it to but
  also the only place around you can get a true cali-style burrito
- [Indy's Sandwich](https://www.indyssandwich.com/) (South Portland)
- [Little Pig](https://www.littlepigportland.com/)

### üòé Nice in the summer (outdoor seating)

- [Terlingua](https://www.terlingua.me/) - a board is always an easy call. If you're only getting
  one dish, make it the brisket taco. Also don't sleep on the veggie apps
- [Mami](https://mamiportland.com/)

### ü•° Takeout

- [Little Pig](https://www.littlepigportland.com/)
- [Sichuan Kitchen](https://www.sichuankitchenportland.com/)
- [Thanh Thanh 2](https://www.facebook.com/p/Thanh-Thanh-2-Restaurant-100046406985824/)

### ü•ê Bakeries

- [BLVL](https://www.blvl.me/) - best croissants
- [Tandem](tandemcoffee.com) - best biscuits

### üåØ Burrito rankings

1. [Taco Trio](https://leewardmaine.com/) (South Portland)
2. [Tacos La Poblanita](https://www.instagram.com/tacoslapoblanitamaine/?hl=en) (South Portland)

- [Dutch's](https://www.dutchsportland.com/) (breakfast burrito)

### ü•Ø Bagel rankings

While these bagels are all good, none of them are truly elite. On a (mostly) unrelated note, I wish
one of them would make an egg bagel (Rose has something they call an egg bagel but it's just a
brioche).

1. [Rover Bagel](https://www.roverbagel.com/) (Biddeford) - they show up at a lot of other
   businesses, including most Big Tree Hospitality spots (e.g. South Freeport Market, Higgins Beach
   Market)
2. [Rose Foods](https://www.rosefoods.me/)
3. [Forage](https://www.foragemarket.com/)
4. [Scratch](https://www.scratchbakingco.com/) (South Portland)

Still need to try:

- [Dutchman's](https://www.dutchmans.me/) (Brunswick)

### ü•û Pancake rankings

1. [Palace Diner](https://www.palacedinerme.com/) (Biddeford) - really in a tier of its own here
2. [Miss Portland Diner](https://missportlanddiner.com/)

- [Papi](https://www.papiportland.com/) - ask for the bartender's recommendation and be willing to

  but they're all good
